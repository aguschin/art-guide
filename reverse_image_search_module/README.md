#**Image Retrieval using ResNet-18 and Annoy Index**

This folder of the repository contains code for performing reverse image search using the ResNet-18 neural network for feature extraction and the Annoy Index for efficient nearest neighbor search. The provided code allows you to generate embeddings for a collection of images, build an Annoy Index from those embeddings, and perform reverse image searches to find similar images from a dataset.
