 ""Check In, Check Out"" is the eigth of nine large-format mixed-media paintings that is a mirror image of Scene 2, ""Room Service"", only the hotel room is completely cleaned up now.  Each painting ranges from emotionally-driven portraits as allegories reminiscent of dramatic film-stills to dark, ambiguous hotel room scenes and metropolitan landscapes on 60"" X 60"" canvases overlaid with mixed-media subway maps painted into the background of each work.
 Bell’s narrative strategy is for the viewer to question how much of Ticket to Ride is just a dream, and how much is rooted in reality. Its major movement is the journey taken by an Italian Femme Fetale that begins on a New York City subway platform awaiting her metaphorical “train” and her journey continues -- painting by painting -- like a roller coaster ride through her mind.
 In the end, the littered hotel room scene from Work 2 is mirrored with an empty hotel room scene in Work 8. The final scene (Work 9) brings the viewer full circle to the same Femme fetale on the subway platform in Work 1, to make us wonder, “Was this all just a dream or a foreshadowing of events to come?” On some level – visually and psychologically - every scene shimmers with unreality from one painting to the next like pieces to a puzzle or clues to a crime, only Bell’s work compels the viewer to participate in the ambiguity of the drama.

<br>""Check In, Check Out"" is the eigth of nine large-format mixed-media paintings that is a mirror image of Scene 2, ""Room Service"", only the hotel room is completely cleaned up now.  Each painting ranges from emotionally-driven portraits as allegories reminiscent of dramatic film-stills to dark, ambiguous hotel room scenes and metropolitan landscapes on 60"" X 60"" canvases overlaid with mixed-media subway maps painted into the background of each work.
<br>
<br>Bell’s narrative strategy is for the viewer to question how much of Ticket to Ride is just a dream, and how much is rooted in reality. Its major movement is the journey taken by an Italian Femme Fetale that begins on a New York City subway platform awaiting her metaphorical “train” and her journey continues -- painting by painting -- like a roller coaster ride through her mind.
<br>
<br>In the end, the littered hotel room scene from Work 2 is mirrored with an empty hotel room scene in Work 8. The final scene (Work 9) brings the viewer full circle to the same Femme fetale on the subway platform in Work 1, to make us wonder, “Was this all just a dream or a foreshadowing of events to come?” On some level – visually and psychologically - every scene shimmers with unreality from one painting to the next like pieces to a puzzle or clues to a crime, only Bell’s work compels the viewer to participate in the ambiguity of the drama.

Featuring a cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Elaine Stritch, Salman Rushdie, Debbie Harry, YouTube ""beatboxer"" Ryan Robinson and Paul Giamatti, River of Fundament draws upon and reconstructs Ancient Evenings, simultaneously incorporating the modern history of the rise and fall of the American car industry.

In another, a woman copulates with a car engine, and in yet another, two women engage in sexual play with a dildo that appears to be made of feces.

The piece drew inspiration from the local natural environment and the population (their culture, tradition, religion, and ritual). Three months prior to the performance, a heavy bronze and glass vitrine was submerged in the sea by a group of divers, in a small cove near the Project Space. The vitrine contained five collaborative drawings produced by Barney and Peyton in pencil and blood, showing animals, agricultural scenes, and mythological figures, as well as a bronze book.At dawn on the day of the performance, local fishermen retrieved the heavy vitrine from the water and carried it up a narrow staircase to the road. Next, the carcass of a dogfish shark (referencing fishing traditions and religious imagery) was laid atop the vitrine. The vitrine and shark were then placed in a wooden cart, pulled by a horse to the site of the former slaughterhouse, accompanied by a procession of human participants. Once inside the slaughterhouse, the head fisherman opened the vitrine, allowing the seawater to pour out dramatically onto the floor, and revealing the artistic contents hidden inside. The bronze book had developed an aquamarine patina, during its three months underwater. The shark was later cooked and fed to visitors. The video of this performance was just one of several artworks (including sculptures by Barney and paintings by Peyton) that comprised the inaugural exhibition of the Project Space, which was supported by the Municipality of Hydra and Hydra's Ecologist Society.The art critic Chris Bors described Blood of Two as ""a ritualistic artwork that encompasses local customs without succumbing to the tropes of cultural tourism"".

643,https://www.wikiart.org/en/matthew-barney/the-cremaster-cycle-2002,The Cremaster Cycle,(stills from films),Matthew Barney,2002,Contemporary,,video,,,,"Barney's magnum opus, The Cremaster Cycle, is comprised of five high-budget, films. Here he employs the narrative modes of mythology, history, and (auto) biography to explore complex biological, artistic, geological, and geographical themes. The films make use of dense, surrealistic, and highly-sexualized imagery, married with vividly-colored and elaborate props, make-up, prosthetics, and costumes. They are filmed in locations ranging from a palace in Budapest, the Isle of Man, and the salt flats of Utah - meanwhile, actors in the series include the actress Ursula Andress, the sculptor Richard Serra, the athlete Aimee Mullins and the writer Norman Mailer. The film's also star chorus girls, tap dancers, Canadian Mounties, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, helicopter pilots, bee trainers, and heavy metal bands.Viewed in order, the films follow the embryonic process of sexual differentiation, beginning in Cremaster 1 with the ""ascended"" or undifferentiated state, and ending in Cremaster 5 at the most ""descended"" or differentiated state, about nine weeks after conception, when the male sex is fully realized. For Barney, the films simultaneously allude to the process of creative development. He explains that Cremaster 1 represents the spark of an idea; Cremaster 2 is the rejection of the idea; Cremaster 3 is the artist falling in love with the idea; Cremaster 4 is panic at the knowledge that the idea is about to come to fruition, and Cremaster 5 is the final resolution.Barney, however, produced and released the five films non-chronologically, beginning with Cremaster 4 (1994), followed by Cremaster 1 (1995), Cremaster 5 (1997), Cremaster 2 (1999), and ending with Cremaster 3 (2002). This discontinuity would seem to underscore Barney's view that these processes (the biological process of becoming, and the artistic process of creating) are complex and non-linear. Even though each film follows a different set of mythological and historical characters, they continually cross-reference (they are ""inter-textual"" in other words). The production designer Matthew D. Ryle asserts that ""anyone can access [the films] from any point; from fashion, horror movies, architecture, drawing, photography, football, plastics - or just story-telling"". But not everyone was won-over by Barney's extravagant vision, with arts journalist Matt Turner describing the series as ""an exhausting experience, demonstrating a weirdness that is wearying, a dedication to a provocation that comes to feel laborious, and much material that feels like baggage"".","The Cremaster Cycle is a series of five feature-length films, together with related sculptures, photographs, drawings, and artist's books, created by American visual artist and filmmaker Matthew Barney.  The Cremaster Cycle was made over a period of eight years (1994–2002) and culminated in a major museum exhibition organized by Nancy Spector of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which traveled to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne and the Musée d'art Moderne in Paris from 2002-03. Barney's longtime collaborator Jonathan Bepler composed and arranged the soundtracks for the films. The series incorporates a multidisciplinary narrative that heavily references connections between real people, real places and real things personal to Barney himself, but are all fictionalized to some extent.  Guggenheim Museum curator Nancy Spector has described the Cremaster cycle (1994–2002) as ""a self-enclosed aesthetic system."" The cycle includes the films as well as photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produced in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, the primary function of which is to raise and lower the testes in response to temperature. The project is filled with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: Cremaster 1 represents the most ""ascended"" or undifferentiated state, Cremaster 5 the most ""descended"" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknown — in Barney's metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond biology as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology. Barney portrays, at various points, a satyr and Gary Gilmore. Ursula Andress portrays the Queen of Chain in Cremaster 5. Norman Mailer, Patty Griffin, and Dave Lombardo portray Harry Houdini, Nicole Baker, and Johnny Cash respectively in Cremaster 2. Richard Serra and Aimee Mullins portray Hiram Abiff and Sadhbh respectively, in Cremaster 3.  While thematically the Cremaster films are chronological in the numbered order, they were not made or released in the same manner. The order in which they were made is as follows:  The numerical order is the thematic order, while in order of production the films increased in production quality, ambition and scope, and they can alternatively be viewed in any order, as different views of a set of themes and preoccupations.  The films are significantly different in length; the longest (and last-made) is Cremaster 3, at over three hours, while the remaining four are approximately an hour each, for a total of approximately seven hours – #3 alone makes up almost half the total length of the cycle. Like Barney's other works, most of the films lack any particular dialogue with the exceptions being Cremaster 2 and 5, the latter of which is an opera sung in Hungarian.  An important precursor of The Cremaster Cycle is Drawing Restraint, which is also a biologically inspired multi-episode work in multiple media, also featuring the field emblem.",,img/full/2fb6a61737e28a8503d9a41eb955df37c39f5d51.jpeg,https://uploads5.wikiart.org/00324/images/matthew-barney/64479168-e9e4-4c5c-8779-9342c479ee50-1632x2040.jpeg!Large.jpeg

Marrying his wife and muse, the artist Rachel Feinstein in 1997, he swiftly gave up the anxious, frustrated and 'burdened' women of his early oeuvre. Amorous depictions of his wife proliferate through the artist's recent body of work, asserting a new focus on idealised beauty and grace. In The Pillow, Currin's woman has a serene elegance, looking with affection at someone of something in the distance. She replaces Currin's earlier female caricatures with a sumptuous and sensual depiction of a woman. Created upon a rich golden-brown ground, the artist illuminates the composition through the slow and smooth process of layering lighter hues of coloured paint. It is a skillful simulation of Leonardo da Vinci's signature technique, sfumato that fosters subtle shade and gentle gradations of tone. Traces of the painting's dark base layers abound in the lustrous lapis silk cushion, the delicate bustier of her dress, the warmth of her eyes, in the body of her ochre hair. It is a skillful composition that beautifully captures the mood and atmosphere of the artist's sitter. It is a painting that departs from the artist's early sensational, and politically activated depictions of sexualized womanhood, speaking instead to the elegance and fine detail of 16th century Mannerism. In particular it recalls the serenity and serpentine postures of the Virgin Mary depicted by Parmigianino, Tintoretto and El Greco as well as Titian's luxuriant, reclining nude, Venus of Urbino (1538).","<p itemprop=""description"">By the end of the 90s, Currin's controversial approach was gradually becoming accepted within artistic circles.

The artist’s virtuoso technique, in combination with a propensity to shock, revived painting at a time when the medium had been eclipsed by video and installation art. From his earliest canvases, Currin’s commitment to paint the female nude has always recognized the entanglement between content and form. As the artist himself has said, “I think that painting has always been essentially about women, about looking at things in the same way that a straight man looks at a woman. The urge to objectify is more a male urge than a female one, and painting is one of the most personal and succinct methods of male objectification of the female”.In Nice ‘n Easy, the luminous creamy skin of two nude women is highlighted by the velvety green background their bodies are presented upon. Their auburn hair is aloft, lifted by an unseen wind that gives the painting a “romantic,” as in relating to golden love, and “Romantic,” as in highly expressive of emotion, quality. The slighter woman on the left places her hand diagonally on the rounded belly of her companion, who looks wistfully into the distance. Currin has purposefully left the narrative ambiguous. It is unclear if the woman caught in a day dream is pregnant, especially since distended and exaggerated anatomies were a signature of the artist’s paintings of nude women up until the point that Nice ‘n Easy was painted. Small breasts, full round bellies and sinuous hips were also a signature of the Renaissance masters Sandro Botticelli and Lucas Cranach the Elder, whose canvases Currin looks to as inspiration.","<p itemprop=""description"">The nude female form has long occupied artists in the history of Western painting and sculpture, but no other artist has approached the subject with such panache as John Currin.

Homemade Pasta is a major work by the artist, complete with present-day cultural complexities and multiple art historical precedents. American genre paintings of all types seem to compel Currin. Norman Rockwell's obvious and pleasing narratives, as well as Maxfield Parrish's glibly stylized works can be seen as precursors to Currin, particularly in their desire to tell a simple and innocent story. In effectively the same format as Rockwell and Parish, Currin seeks to bring a truly contemporary message to his works and interweaves the social, the political and the humorous, at times with impunity.In Homemade Pasta, Currin paints a blissfully dull domestic scene-a couple standing in their kitchen engaged in the clichi gourmet act of home-making pasta. The Italian red checkered apron, restaurant-style wire rack shelving, and the semi-professional hand grinder tell the viewers that we are in a late twentieth century urban American kitchen, influenced by the do-it-yourself sophistication of television cooking shows, Martha Stewart and the American desire to embrace international cuisines. In Currin's matter-of-fact rendering, the couple of today is a gay male couple. They are exquisitely realized in perfect detail and Currin's painterly virtuosity is flexed. But contrary to historical imagery of gay male couples (if there is such a thing), they are the antithesis of sexual beings. Currin has been able to demonstrate that the two men share affection for another without actually showing it. The subjects in Homemade Pasta speak to a truism about gay domestic life in the post-AIDS era - cozy at home, yearning for marriage rights, warm guys who seem to vaguely look alike as a side effect of all their years together. While the subjects are utterly ordinary looking, Currin has not forgotten their subtle affectations - thick middles and narrow shoulders, elongated, delicate fingers, hairless faces. The painting is clearly affectionately rendered, but Currin's attention to detail can make even the gay viewer squeamish. So startlingly true to life, it's gay life sans lifestyle.As Currin takes his place in art history, his indelible mark will no doubt be on how he re-affirmed the power of genre painting. By looking at scenes from everyday life with his unique lens of unconventional beauty, Currin brings to light just how socially and aesthetically transgressive turn of the millennium American culture looks. Busty females at the bra shop, nude women of impossible proportions intertwined against a black backdrop, two bare-backed men biblically perched on the back of a fishing boat, a gay couple preparing a meal in their kitchen - Currin is never short on compelling, if even at times archetypal visuals.

Classically composed, highly stylised and painted in the manner of traditional portraiture, Currin’s figure is centrally placed, carefully modeled through light and shade against a baize-like background. Operating at a time when the contemporary art world had declared painting dead, Currin cultivated an ability to destabilise through a language of ostensibly well-established tropes. Indeed, as we contemplate the young man himself, we realise that this is far from an exercise in pastiche. In his effeminate, almost androgynous appearance, Currin’s subject is a fundamentally postmodern protagonist, charged with an ambiguity that offsets the artist’s anachronistic painterly vocabulary. In disturbing the relationship between form and content, Currin’s beguiling figure draws the viewer into a dialogue in which we are continually prompted to question our assumptions.Throughout the 1990s, Currin developed a pictorial style geared towards questioning social norms, as well as challenging artistic trends towards self-critical irony.

The dramtatic foreshortening of this composition is designed to challenge the viewer to look up at the figure's face, the usual first point of call in observing humans in real life or representations.

When his father would read him books or tell him stories, he would always describe things in great detail, which later helped artist with the subject matter for his compositions. His influence on Israel Tsvaygenbaum is tremendous. Though the painting “People of Derbent” is dedicated to the people of his birth city Derbent (a town in Southern Russia) and the surroundings do look like the city, the people were painted based on impressions that his father gave him about Jews in Poland. Much of Israel Tsvaygenbaum childhood in this city was so closely linked with his father’s stories of Poland, regardless of the difference of time, generation and culture between these two places.

Fairbanks Art and Nature Park, in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The artwork consists of an enclosed park space in the form of a square placed within a square, the inner parameter being made from limestone-filled gabion baskets, and the outer from indigenous trees and shrubs. The park space is only accessible by a concrete enclosed tunnel. The installation has a landscape design that consists of over 3,000 individual plants species from 53 different genera.Park of the Laments is situated in the woodland area southeast of the lake in 100 acres. The overall form of the park is a square within a square, one rigid and made of limestone-filled gabion baskets, while the other consisting of indigenous trees and shrubs. Natural, minimalist wooden benches, made from kiln-treated poplar, are built into the edge of an amphitheater of stairs, vines, and stones. The viewer begins their experience by walking down a concrete platform flanked on both sides with limestone-filled gabion baskets and indigenous shrubbery. During their walk, the baskets become taller in the form of a progressive step system that correlates with the actual topography of the landscape; the minimum height being at approximately 2’, and the maximum at about 12’. At that point the viewer is taken underground through a dark, pre-cast concrete “box culvert” tunnel (made of nine individual segments, attached and mortared together) and walk towards the sunlit area on the other end of the tunnel. The entire length of the tunnel is approximately 72’ in length. The visitor then proceeds up the stairs to reach the enclosed park area, where no other portion of the Art & Nature Park is visible due to both the surrounding gabion baskets and natural woodlands. There the visitor may sit or interact with the space and be surrounded by over 53 different indigenous plant species located within the installation (more than 3,000 plants total).Park of the Laments is a project that follows along the lines of Jaar’s Public Intervention series in which the viewer/visitor is an active participant within the environment and contributes to the underlying theme or concept of the project. Visitors enter the work outside the park and continue through an underground tunnel. Moving towards the light, they approach stairs that lead them above ground into the center of the park where they are greeted by an isolated, calm, and secluded area conducive to meditation and lamentation. Like many of Jaar’s Interventions, the intention of the space’s design is to initiate a physical, emotional, and psychological journey within the viewer, ultimately drawing parallels between the experience of physical space and human emotion.","<p itemprop=""description"">Park of the Laments is a public artwork by Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar, located in the 100 Acres: The Virginia B.

The idea proved controversial even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, but in 1994, Christo and Jeanne-Claude finally received permission for this most ambitious project.

The fabric created a walkable surface between Sulzano, Monte Isola and the island of San Paolo.  Christo and Jeanne-Claude began conceptualizing of The Floating Piers in 1970. Their initial site was Rio de la Plata between Argentina and Uruguay. The couple also considered Tokyo Bay as a location before moving on to other projects.  In late 2013, Christo settled on Lake Iseo as the location for The Floating Piers and dedicated the next 22 months to realizing the project. It was the first major project he undertook after the death of his partner and collaborator Jeanne-Claude.  The project was estimated to cost $11 million, but was later reported at closer to $17 million. The funds were raised by Christo himself through sales of his project sketches and original art. Permits took less than a year.  The physical installation of the piers was handled by Deep Dive Systems, a company based in Bulgaria. They installed about 220 six-ton anchors in the lake floor at depths of up to 92 meters, over a period of three months. 226,000 cubes were then attached to those anchors, and covered by 70,000 sq. meters of nylon fabric. Over 600 workers were involved in the installation. Traffic planning required a 175-page document and cost €100,000 to produce.  On June 18, 2016, the saffron-colored walkway opened to the public. 270,000 people visited the free installation in its first five days. Due to the unexpectedly large crowds, organizers began closing the installation from midnight to 6 a.m. each day to allow for cleaning. On June 22, the large crowds caused some chaos at the main train station in nearby Brescia.  On July 3, 2016, the work closed to the public; local officials estimated that it had attracted 1.2 million visitors, or an average of 72,000 per day, over its 16-day run. Police estimates were even higher, at 100,000 visitors per day. Dismantling of the project began in the early morning of July 4, 2016.

Viewers are encouraged to take a piece of candy, and the diminishing amount parallels Ross’s weight loss and suffering prior to his death.

Is this stack of papers on the floor meant to be walked around and viewed from different angles, like sculpture? Or did the artist intend these papers to be picked up and examined?

These images and words, appropriated from Time magazine, where they first appeared, reflect González-Torres's interest in gun control.
Conceptually, Death by Gun is an ongoing work of art. Viewer participation is an important element, and the public is encouraged to read the sheets and take them away to keep, display, or give to others. While González-Torres determined that the stack is ""ideally"" nine inches high, he arranged for the depleted sheets to be continually reprinted and replaced, thus insuring that Death by Gun can be distributed indefinitely. From its beginnings, printed art has been made in multiple copies for dissemination to a wide audience. Here that idea is expanded with an edition that is ""endless.""
Deborah Wye, Artists and Prints: Masterworks from The Museum of Modern Art, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2004, p. 245
Printed art by Félix González-Torres stands in bold contrast to the etchings, woodcuts, lithographs, and screenprints that make up the traditional history of modern print-making. González-Torres did not pursue this medium for the expressive possibilities inherent in its various techniques but, instead, chose it for its ability to function within his broader conceptual practice. The commercial offset process (photolithography) offered him a vehicle that was easy and inexpensive to produce, and also endlessly replicable. The fact that its surfaces maintained the detached, second-generation appearance of his often grainy photographic sources was a feature that suited his message of ephemerality rather than permanence.
Stacks of printed paper, in the form of sculptural objects with Minimalist overtones, constitute a major component of González-Torres's work, which also encompasses such projects as installations of wrapped candy, hanging cords of lightbulbs, and beaded curtains. His printed art extended as well to billboards, give-away booklets, and newspaper inserts, often incorporating his own or found photographs. A gentle, poetic mood emanates from much of this art, suggesting poignant memories or provoking thoughtful consideration of social issues.
While González-Torres dealt with gay rights, AIDS, and a variety of governmental abuses in his own work and as a member of the collective Group Material, the subject of ""Untitled"" (Death by Gun), and its treatment, is unusually specific for him. Appropriating imagery from Time magazine, it presents 460 individuals killed by gunshot in one week in the United States, and includes the name, age, and circumstances of death for each person depicted. No opinion about gun control is added by the artist. Here an issue of public debate engages anyone who follows the artist's intention and takes away one of his sheets.

1967,https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman/untitled-1980,Untitled,,Francesca Woodman,,,,self-portrait,photography,,,"This black and white square-format photograph shows the artist Francesca Woodman crouching against a dilapidated wall. The wall is heavily marked and stained, with two sections of wallpaper remnants, one darker and one lighter, to the right of the frame and a black mark above the artist’s head. There is a skirting board where the wall meets the wooden floor, which is strewn with paint chips and debris. Woodman’s body is oriented to the centre of the frame, occupying the bottom right corner of the image. Her head is in three quarter profile as she looks directly at the camera. She wears a mid-length dress with a black polka dot pattern and long sleeves. The dress is partially unzipped along the left side of her body exposing her abdomen and the bottom of her breast. Her left hand is positioned above her breast as if holding the dress open, while her right hand covers her mouth; her fingers are spread across her cheek and her thumb is in her mouth.This photograph was taken in 1976 in Providence, Rhode Island during which time Woodman was a student at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). This image belongs to a series of five photographs titled the Polka Dot series, which were all shot in the same interior space with Woodman wearing the same polka dot dress. The artist often worked in series and favoured shooting in decrepit, run-down interiors. Her friend and fellow RISD student Sloan Rankin stated that, ‘Francesca was at ease in everything that was dusty, and had predilection for mold.’ (Quoted in Baker, Daly, Davenport 2003, p.66.) Woodman’s use of dilapidated and abandoned interiors creates a feeling of being out of time, which is heightened by her vintage clothing bought at thrift stores.Woodman often photographed herself, but in the majority of the self-portraits her face or body is obscured, veiled, or distorted in some manner. The art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto has noted that Woodman ‘never shows herself as herself. The difference is that she always shows herself as the same character – the character of a young woman in various mise-en-scenes.’ (Quoted in Pierini 2009, p.21.) This idea of performing a character is supported by author and art historian Chris Townsend who has suggested that, in this particular image, Woodman plays the part of ‘the mistreated heroine in a Victorian melodrama’ with whom she self-identified (Chris Townsend, Francesca Woodman: Scattered in Space and Time, London 2006, p.21). However, the apparent vulnerability on display in this image – suggested by the artist’s crouching pose and hand splayed defensively across her face – is tempered by Woodman’s focused gaze to the camera and bodily exposure.","<p itemprop=""description"">This black and white square-format photograph shows the artist Francesca Woodman crouching against a dilapidated wall.

1968,https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman/untitled-4,"Providence, Rhode Island",,Francesca Woodman,,,,self-portrait,photography,,14.3 x 14.4 cm,"This black and white square-format photograph features the artist sitting in a chair in the corner of an abandoned interior space. The room has bare floorboards and a heavy skirting board. On the right of the composition, behind the artist, is a window through which light enters the scene, while on the left is what looks like a filled-in window surround. Woodman is seated on a white wooden chair and is nude except for a necklace and a pair of dark single-strap ‘Mary Jane’ style shoes. She wears her hair up, with a single lock falling on the right side of her face. Looking straight at the camera, she sits upright with her legs almost together and her feet tucked in close to the chair, while her hands are positioned in her lap just between her legs. Her bare breasts and torso are lighter in colour than the rest of her skin. On the a particularly white area of the floor to her right, forming a diagonal from where she sits, is a dark silhouette or impression of what looks like a female body, with its head at the artist’s feet. The outline is only partial, missing its forearms, hands and left leg.The photograph, as the title suggests, was taken in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1976, and is one of a series of similar images. Woodman created the dark impression on the floor by lying on her back in photosensitive powder scattered over the floorboards. The areas of powder exposed to light turned white, while those in shadow turned black. This is known as a ‘shadowgraph’. One of Woodman’s videos shows her undertaking the process for this series. The photograph itself was taken with a long exposure, which produces glowing whites: the light coming in from the window behind Woodman has completely obliterated any detail of the outside world, and the powder on the floor appears to shimmer.Woodman's photographs frequently depict female forms in empty, tightly cropped interior spaces. This corresponds with the small size of the photographs themselves, which rarely exceed twenty centimetres square, allowing for what the critic Jane Simon has described as ‘an intimate experience between the viewer and the photograph’ (Simon 2010, p.28). Establishing a close relationship between the viewer and the artwork allowed Woodman to convey a sense of fragility and vulnerability in relation to the external world, as suggested by the artist’s closed pose and anxious expression in this photograph. Although she was the model in most of her work, Woodman’s photographs do not function as typical self-portraits. Rather, she used her own image to explore the representation of gender and the relation of the body to its environment. Her use of objects associated with budding femininity, like the ‘Mary Jane’ shoes, set within a decaying interior space, a site often associated with female domesticity, challenges idealised, constructed notions of femininity.The impression on the floor, which reveals the darker, rough floorboards below, creates the illusion of a body sinking through a surface, or perhaps floating through light. This supernatural imagery corresponds to the artist’s interest in the surrealist movement of the early twentieth century, and perhaps alludes to the American artist Man Ray’s signature Rayograms, which, in reverse of Woodman’s dark imprint, feature light bodies and objects on dark grounds. The feature may also refer directly to Erotique Voilée 1933 (Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid), Man Ray’s portrait of his fellow surrealist Méret Oppenheim at a printing press. In Ray’s photograph, Oppenheim’s arm is smeared with ink, which creates a dark imprint of her body similar to the imprint Woodman created for her photograph.","<p itemprop=""description"">This black and white square-format photograph features the artist sitting in a chair in the corner of an abandoned interior space.

This focus is partly aesthetic, reflecting a need to break from immediate precedents—the dematerialized linguistic propositions of Conceptual art, or the hard, machine-made, geometric surfaces of Minimalism. But the period also saw intense public debate on issues of sexuality and health, and on their convergence in the AIDS crisis. </p>","Bottle,Glassbottle,Water,Cylinder",img/full/d6b59b2a20ef1895fb4a562275d9ec28c6344351.jpg,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/kiki-smith/untitled-1990.jpg

The sculpture appropriates the image of the revered matriarch of Catholicism, but removes the luster of centuries of veneration to reveal those vital differences that elevate her above all women.The wax figure is nearly life-size, depicting a nude body without skin, revealing the musculoskeletal system, while the head, hands, breasts, genitalia, and feet retain their pale flesh. The sculpture's open-arm posture is reminiscent of Eurocentric 'Virgin Mary' images and early Christianity's Orans figures. However, Smith withholds Mary's traditional attributes, including the halo, blue robe, bejeweled crown, lilies, roses, and nursing infant, which generated an otherworldly aura meant to elevate her above all women.Smith's sculpture invites viewers to acknowledge the woman beneath the veneer of holy mysticism, revealing Mary as simply flesh and blood. By retaining the portions of her body for which she was adored, such as her breasts, uterus, and hands, Smith's sculpture exposes the affinity Mary shares with all women, including the blood and bodily functions, muscle, sinew, and bone. The viewer is left with a conundrum, forced to decide whether the venerated figure was simply human or if a woman's body is truly sacred.","<p itemprop=""description"">Smith's sculpture, Virgin Mary, explores the elemental functions of the female body from a Feminist perspective while incorporating the iconography of her Catholic faith.

Three monkeys, which resemble very much inflatable children's toys, are connected together. They form a chain that dangles from the ceiling. A white straw chair is attached at the lowest end of the chain. The sculpture illustrates Jeff Koon's fascination for children's toys which becomes particularly evident in the Popeye Series for which Koons sought inspiration in floating aids in the shape of animals.[2] The monkeys that feature in the sculpture remind of the game Barrel of Monkeys in which the players have to gain the hook-tailed monkeys in a chain. Monkeys (Chair) is an example of Koons's strategy of mashing up ideas and methods of Pop, Conceptual, and appropriation art with handicraft and popular culture.[3]The monkey figures are made of polychromed aluminium. Real plastic toys served as a template for the execution of this work of art. The shiny surface of the metal helps creating a perfect illusion. The transfer into another material creates new static conditions which allow the attachment of the chair at the lowest end of the chain.In this work Jeff Koons plays with different material perceptions. The monkeys seem to be made of plastic, but this impression contradicts the sculpture's static properties. If the chain of monkeys was made of inflatable toys, it could not support the heavy weight of the chair. The spectator's only possibility to resolve this contradictory perception is to take a look at the artwork's label.","<p itemprop=""description"">The sculpture is a somewhat surreal combination of everyday objects.

Monkeys (Chair) is an example of Koons's strategy of mashing up ideas and methods of Pop, Conceptual, and appropriation art with handicraft and popular culture.[3]<br><br>The monkey figures are made of polychromed aluminium. Real plastic toys served as a template for the execution of this work of art. The shiny surface of the metal helps creating a perfect illusion. The transfer into another material creates new static conditions which allow the attachment of the chair at the lowest end of the chain.<br><br>In this work Jeff Koons plays with different material perceptions. The monkeys seem to be made of plastic, but this impression contradicts the sculpture's static properties. If the chain of monkeys was made of inflatable toys, it could not support the heavy weight of the chair. The spectator's only possibility to resolve this contradictory perception is to take a look at the artwork's label.</p>","monkeys,Chair,Inflatable",img/full/66326530fad398d528f290023661dc15a9673d26.jpg,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/00422/images/jeff-koons/tumblr-nck3n334uf1tcjq28o1-1280.jpg!Large.jpg

I never told my parents about the nightmare but every time it happened I was overwhelmed by it. Then one night I decided that I am not going to wake up I am going to continue in the car and see what happens. The most astonishing thing happened, the experience turned to pleasure.

I realized that my willingness to risk everything when I paint was learned from that experience. My painting 'Memory' is about my childhood nightmare.

2558,https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/painting-for-malik-joyeux-and-bernardo-bertolucci-v-2006,Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V),,Julian Schnabel,2006,Neo-Expressionism,Surf Paintings (2006-2008),figurative,photography,,609.6 x 457.2 cm,"Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V) (2006) belongs to a series of Surf Paintings. Schnabel used black and white photographs as the basis for his paintings to which he added gestural strokes painted in soluble gesso and ink. The giant photograph depicts a surfer catching a monster wave at the Banzai Pipeline off Oahu in Hawaii. In Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V), water is both the subject and the material of the painting. The gestural white mark created with gesso is then partially washed off with a hose, which creates this type of unique dripping effect. The enormous canvas (609.6x457.2 cm) amplifies the wave and makes the viewers feel like they are inside it. It is also the purpose of the white mark; with his gestural strokes, Schnabel echoes the photographic image of the wave.The title suggests Schnabel’s admiration for two figures: the Tahitian Big Wave surfer Malik Joyeux, who tragically died in a surfing accident in 2005 at the Oahu Pipeline in Hawaii, and the Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci. More broadly, the series combined Schanbel’s two passions, film, and surfing. For Schnabel, the ocean and the sea are essential, and water, in general, is a noticeable element in his art: in paintings such as The Sea (1981) and Affection for Surfing (1983), and his films. From his youth, Schnabel became immersed in surf culture, and later, he chose to live and paint in Montauk, New York - a place where he can surf and always be close to the water.Schnabel watched Bertolucci’s movies in the 1970s while living in Europe. His painting Giacomo Expelled from the Temple (1976-1978), located in the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), was first called Restaurant Painting for Bernardo. Schnabel initially connected the painting to Bertolluci since the warm light of his films inspired the artist. Years later, Schnabel met Bertolucci, and the two became close friends. According to Schnabel, the concept of the series came about from his conversations with Bertolucci, who at the time was worried about his health and his ability to continue making films. Schnabel found that there is a parallel between surfing and creating art, the physical struggle and pain involved with surfing ultimately are done for the extraordinary sensation of being in the wave. This feeling is a kind of transcendence in which one is relieved of everything ordinary and familiar. Schnabel wanted to send this message of encouragement to Bertolucci, whose motivation for making movies was to put forward something from within that goes beyond physical limitations. Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V) (2006) brings together two unlikely figures. In dedicating the series to Joyeux and Bertolucci, Schnabel made a connection between two individuals that never had an opportunity to meet. It illustrated the power of art to make a connection between people that could not happen in reality.","<p itemprop=""description""><i>Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V)</i> (2006) belongs to a series of <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/all-works#!#filterName:Series_surf-paintings-2006,resultType:masonry""><i>Surf Paintings</i></a>. Schnabel used black and white photographs as the basis for his paintings to which he added gestural strokes painted in soluble gesso and ink. The giant photograph depicts a surfer catching a monster wave at the Banzai Pipeline off Oahu in Hawaii. In <i>Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V)</i>, water is both the subject and the material of the painting. The gestural white mark created with gesso is then partially washed off with a hose, which creates this type of unique dripping effect. The enormous canvas (609.6x457.2 cm) amplifies the wave and makes the viewers feel like they are inside it. It is also the purpose of the white mark; with his gestural strokes, Schnabel echoes the photographic image of the wave.<br><br>The title suggests Schnabel’s admiration for two figures: the Tahitian Big Wave surfer Malik Joyeux, who tragically died in a surfing accident in 2005 at the Oahu Pipeline in Hawaii, and the Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci.

In the 1980s, Warhol developed friendships with a younger generation of artists, which were considered part of the Neo-expressionist movement. Among them were Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Salle, and Julian Schnabel. The friendship between Warhol and Schnabel resulted in an artistic exchange. The same year Schnabel painted Portrait of Andy Warhol (1982), Warhol reciprocated by creating Julian Schnabel (1982). Most of Schnabel’s portraits were done from real life and executed without preliminary drawings. This portrait was no exception, as Warhol sat for Schnabel a few times until he completed the painting. Schnabel portrayed a thin and fragile Warhol, who appears to be in a weak state, almost like a ghost; he seems to dematerialize in front of the viewer. Warhol is depicted shirtless wearing a supporting garment around his waist, marked with pink brushstrokes. The supporting device was due to 1968 attempted the murder of Warhol by radical feminist Valerie Solanas. This left a profound impact on Warhol, who was deeply traumatized by the incident.Schnabel continued his use of unconventional materials by choosing to paint on black velvet. The shiny quality of the velvet allows the color palette of light tones, yellows, grays, and pinks to stand out. In Schnabel’s art, the use of unconventional materials is an essential element: whether its broken plates, velvet, or fur, they all produce pictorial and psychological effects. When the viewers notice the everyday object incorporated in the paintings, they have the memory and association of the object’s everyday use and function.  Scholars have pointed out how Schnabel subtly references different artists in the portrait’s color palette, style, and atmosphere. For instance, Warhol’s vulnerable presence and wiry figure evoke a similar mood as the figures of the saints painted by Spanish Renaissance artist El Greco. Schnabel possibly wanted to provoke religious connotations since many of his works feature Catholic iconography and themes. The painting has a sense of mystery that can be interpreted as a mystic or spiritual quality. In the same way, the colors and dark mood can be associated with the portraits of Expressionist painter Francis Bacon, like Study for a Portrait I (After the life mask of William Blake)[/url] (1955) and Man in Blue VII (1954).The artist chose to place Warhol on the left side of the canvas, allowing different elements to play out on the other side of the painting. Schnabel fills the right side of the canvas with white dots and small strokes of blue and yellow. At the center of the painting, there is a mark of brown paint - this type of biomorphic shape will become frequent in Schnabel’s later paintings. The dark background may represent a movie theater, and the specks of color are glittering dust coming from the light of the film projector.","<p itemprop=""description"">In <i>Portrait of Andy Warhol</i> (1982), Julian Schnabel presented an eerie image of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art"">Pop</a> artist and cultural icon <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol"">Andy Warhol</a>.

Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry,,Julian Schnabel,1984,Neo-Expressionism,,figurative,,,,"Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry (1984) was inspired by the 1984 John Huston film rendition of Malcolm Lowry’s novel Under the Volcano. The movie starred Albert Finney as Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic British consul in the Mexican town of Quanhnahuac on Día de Muertos (the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead). Schnabel often connected his painting to the world of cinema, referencing films, actors, and directors in his titles: Pool Painting (for Norma Desmond) (1975), Untitled (Brando) (2008), and Last Diary Entry (For Roman Polanski) (2010). Schnabel’s painting depicts El Ninõ de Atocha, the Roman Catholic image of Child Christ, which is famous throughout Spanish speaking countries like Mexico. The artist painted the traditional attributes of El Ninõ de Atocha - the halo, the pilgrim’s cloak, and the staff. In the backdrop, Schnabel painted a crude landscape that creates the effect of a levitating figure. The artist’s interest in Catholic iconography, especially the one connected to Mexican culture, is prominent in many of his paintings. At the age of 13, Schnabel and his family moved to the border town of Brownsville, Texas. There he became familiar with Mexican culture; later, as an adult, he often traveled to Mexico. Schnabel’s familiarity with Mexican culture and folk art is evident in Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry. He echoes religious imagery of Mexican folk art: retablo, a small devotional painting that serves as a votive offering, and milagros, a religious folk charm used for votive offering or healing purposes.Schnabel may have been drawn to religious imagery because he seeked to channel spirituality and mysticism. In Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry he channeled elements of Mexican devotional folk art into creating a contemporary spiritual image. His paintings are imaginary encounters between personalities that could not meet in real life like Malcolm Lowry and Albert Finney, and Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci in Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V) (2006). Although many of Schnabel’s paintings feature Catholic iconography, the artist explored a variety of religious concepts in his art, for example, Fakires (1993) referenced Sufi mysticism and Untitled (Shiva) (2007) is one of several paintings dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.In Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry, Schnabel depicts a traditional religious subject combining several modernist styles of painting. The face is reminiscent of Pablo Picasso’s portraits, the splatter technique is suggestive of Jackson Pollock, and spray-painted lines allude to Dan Christensen’s abstract paintings. Schnabel also continued to experiment with unconventional materials by executing the painting on purple velvet. The artist demonstrated his creativity and innovation by integrating traditional subject matter, modernist style, and use of unconventional materials. In the painting, he pays tribute to the artistic encounter between Lowry’s literary creation and Albert Finney’s performance in the medium of cinema. In a sense, Schnabel continues the dialogue between different mediums by giving a visual interpretation of Under the Volcano.","<p itemprop=""description""><i>Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry</i> (1984) was inspired by the 1984 John Huston film rendition of Malcolm Lowry’s novel <i>Under the Volcano</i>.

Schnabel also continued to experiment with unconventional materials by executing the painting on purple velvet. The artist demonstrated his creativity and innovation by integrating traditional subject matter, modernist style, and use of unconventional materials. In the painting, he pays tribute to the artistic encounter between Lowry’s literary creation and Albert Finney’s performance in the medium of cinema. In a sense, Schnabel continues the dialogue between different mediums by giving a visual interpretation of <i>Under the Volcano</i>.</p>",,img/full/7ec7b0fbc8b529001d4168092c81c5ac6e8b96a0.jpg,https://uploads6.wikiart.org/00286/images/julian-schnabel/resurrection-albert-finney-meets-malcolm-lowry-1984.jpg!Large.jpg

Spain and other plate paintings from the period, such as The Red Sky (1984) and Australia (1986), were created from broken dishes, thick layers of oil paint and Bondo - a type of putty used for automotive and household repairs. These stood in contrast to Minimal and Conceptual art, the prevailing trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Scholars have categorized Schnabel as a Neo-expressionist (a term that the artist does not wholly identify with), and one of the significant figures in the 1980s revival of the traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. At the same time, Schnabel did not conform to painting conventions: he was experimental in his approach and use of unconventional materials and techniques. It is evident in his 1980s plate paintings, and it remains a significant component of his work throughout his career. This approach can also be linked to earlier trends in the Post-Minimalist sculpture and the works of early 1970s abstract artists, such as Alan Shields and Harmony Hammond.In 'plate paintings', such as Spain, Schnabel built on the legacy of Abstract Expressionism, the art movement that developed after World War II. The overall effect of the thick impasto and the sculptural surfaces in Spain is similar to the expressive brushstrokes and splatters of Jackson Pollock’s paintings Mural on Indian red ground (1950) and Number 25 (1950). Schnabel also combined other sources of inspiration for his 1980s 'plate paintings' like cubist forms of Pablo Picasso and cultural artifacts found in Mexico. Another essential characteristic of the 'plate paintings' is their monumental size; Spain, for instance, stands at 333x513 cm, overwhelming the viewer.Spain is representative of Schnabel’s fascination with the country and its culture. It was inspired by the artist’s 1987 visit to Barcelona, especially by the architecture of Antonio Gaudí, whose structures are an integral part of the city’s identity. The texture created by the broken plates is reminiscent of the mosaic elements in Gaudí’s Casa Milà and Park Güell. In 'plate paintings' like Spain, Schnabel transformed the surface of the artwork: the jagged edges of broken plates and cups bulge out to create a unique kind of texture, similar to a low relief. The central motif in the painting appears to be a severed head, which is a recurrent theme in Schnabel’s work. The head seems to be situated in a bullfighting ring, located behind a burladero - a barrier used by bullfighters for protection from the bull. The snout-like face can belong either to a bull or a bullfighter, making the scene somewhat ambiguous and unclear. Schnabel selected a warm palette of earthy tones of reds and ochres, mixed with dark tones that mark long shadows. The color scheme could be a reference to a Spanish landscape, or it might symbolize the colors of the Spanish national flag.","<p itemprop=""description"">Julian Schnabel is best known for his 'plate paintings', like <i>Spain</i> (1986).

The origin of the 'plate technique' was Schnabel’s 1978 trip to Barcelona, Spain. There, he encountered the architecture of Antonio Gaudí and the intricate mosaic elements in Casa Milà and Park Güell. While in Barcelona, Schnabel imagined creating a giant painting covered with broken plates, which would match the size of the closet in his hotel room. After his return to New York, he implemented his vision, covering large wooden surfaces with broken dishes and thick layers of paint. The success of Schnabel and other Neo-Expressionist artists represented a shift in American art, which was dominated by Minimalism and Conceptual art in previous decades.In this painting, Schnabel descends into art history by combining an array of references in an original and personal way. The artist divided Bob’s Worlds into three sections, like the closet in his Barcelona hotel room. The left panel is narrow and covered with fragments of broken dishes, the central panel is purple with two large intertwining flowers, and the right panel also covered with broken plates features a sturdy sower walking with a hefty stack over his shoulder. In between the left and central panel, there is a nude male figure resembling a remnant of Greco-Roman sculpture. The image of the sower is mainly associated with the paintings of Vincent Van Gogh Sower (1888) and Sower with Setting Sun (1888). The thick impasto effect further establishes a connection between Schnabel and Van Gogh. Still, at the same time, Schnabel sets himself apart by creating a unique sculptural surface with fragments of broken dishes. Expressionist painter Francis Bacon also reinterpreted the motif of the sower in paintings like Study for Portrait of Van Gogh I (1956). Even though in Bob’s Worlds, Schnabel drew inspiration from a variety of references to art history, his innovative combination created new associations for the viewer. For instance, the unique technique of broken plates can be associated with archeological remains of an ancient civilization. It also relates to the drip and splatter techniques of Abstract Expressionist painting.  The title Bob’s Worlds most likely refers to Bob Williamson, a fixture of the New York downtown culture scene during the late 1970s. He and Schnabel became close friends, and Williamson was a mentor figure for the artist. Another possibility is that Schnabel thought of Bob Mason, a young artist who was also his former assistant.","<p itemprop=""description""><i>Bob’s Worlds</i> (1980) is one of Julian Schnabel’s early 'broken plate paintings'.

The slot gradually descends to fifteen feet in depth, running underneath the boulder. As with other works by the artist, such as Double Negative (1969), the monumental negative form is key to the experience of the artwork.
 Heizer conceived of the artwork in 1969; a drawing of the work is in the collection of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. The artist discovered an appropriate boulder only decades later, in Riverside County, California. The boulder is one component of the artwork, as is the 456-foot-long slot beneath it and the surrounding environment.
 Taken whole, Levitated Mass speaks to the expanse of art history, from ancient traditions of creating artworks from megalithic stone, to modern forms of abstract geometries and cutting-edge feats of engineering.","<p itemprop=""description"">Levitated Mass by artist Michael Heizer is composed of a 456-foot-long slot constructed on LACMA's campus, over which is placed a 340-ton granite megalith.

The work consists of a long trench in the earth, 30 feet (9 m) wide, 50 feet (15 m) deep, and 1500 feet (457 m) long, created by the displacement of 244,000 tons of rock, mostly rhyolite and sandstone. Two trenches straddle either side of a natural canyon (into which the excavated material was dumped). The ""negative"" in the title thus refers in part to both the natural and man-made negative space that constitutes the work. The work essentially consists of what is not there, what has been displaced.
 In 1969 the art dealer Virginia Dwan funded the purchase of the 60-acre site for Double Negative and in turn the artist transferred the property deeds to Dwan. In 1971 Heizer prevented the Dwan Gallery from selling the work. Dwan then donated Double Negative to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MoCA) in 1984, with Heizer’s blessing, to coincide with “In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction”. Among the terms of the agreement with the museum is the fact that, according to the artist's wishes, MoCA will undertake no conservation of the piece as Heizer wants nature to eventually reclaim the land through weather and erosion.
 For the solo exhibition ""In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction"", MoCA was able to include a photographic pan­o­rama of Heizer’s work. For the large-scale, historical survey of land art “Ends of the Earth” at MoCA in 2012, Heizer did not want any representation of Double Negative to be included in the exhibition. A good aerial photograph appears in the informative catalog, but Heizer reportedly worried that documentation in a museum gallery misrepresents sculpture that can be known only through physical experience.
 The work is currently owned by MoCA and is accessible by four-wheel drive vehicle or motorcycle.","<p itemprop=""description"">Double Negative is a piece of land art located in the Moapa Valley on Mormon Mesa (or Virgin River Mesa) near Overton, Nevada.

Their eight-year collaboration on this project began in 1985 as a journey through Europe and the Middle East to explore the meaning of the Holocaust in a contemporary context. It was a journey of self-discovery through which Chicago came to understand the strength of her Jewish identity and its influence on her ideas about the artist’s role and the need to create art that aims to transform the world. It was also a journey into darkness that was, needless to say, immensely disturbing on many levels. The result was an exhibition that combined painting and photography, with additional work in tapestry and glass by selected artisans. To conclude the exhibition, Chicago wanted an image of hope, a vision for a future in which people are joined together across differences in age, gender, race, faith and culture to live in harmony with one another and the natural world. She chose to represent this vision in a large stained glass installation, ""Rainbow Shabbat: A Vision for the Future,"" because in her words, ""Light is Life."" The idea for the Rainbow Shabbat as an image and message of hope came to Chicago during a memorable Shabbat dinner at the home of friends during a visit she and Woodman made to Israel. As she later wrote: ""There were twelve people there: men and women from four different countries, of different ages, and mostly strangers. We all went around the table and told stories, and everyone listened for hours. For me the evening brought up not just feelings about my childhood but also the incredibly warm moments Donald and I had shared with Jews around the world. Being welcomed into Jewish homes during our travels gave us a profound sense of a global community and provided me with an idea for the last image of the project, an image of optimism and hope."" Chicago chose to depict the Shabbat service with the heads of everyone turned toward the woman—as they would be during her blessing over the candles—while her husband raises his Kiddush cup and sings his wife’s praises. As Chicago intended, this compresses the actual sequence of Shabbat events but stays true to its spirit. It also celebrates both the Jewish and the female experience, suggesting that both offer the potential for human transformation. In addition to the central window, there are two side panels incorporating a prayer in English and Yiddish, based on a poem by a survivor from Theresienstadt: Heal those broken souls who have no peace and lead us all from darkness into light.","<p itemprop=""description"">""Rainbow Shabbat"" (1992) is the concluding image in ""the Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light,"" a traveling exhibition that Chicago created in collaboration with her husband, the photographer Donald Woodman.

Describing her motivation for the series in her 1996 autobiography, she wrote: “Over the years I had listened to women share their fears, rage, and frustration about how men acted both in private and in the world. Yet I knew that I didn’t want to keep perpetuating the use of the female body as the repository of so many emotions; it seemed as if everything—love, dread, longing, loathing, desire, and terror—was projected onto the female by both male and female artists, albeit with often differing perspectives. I wondered what feelings the male body might be made to express. Also, I wanted to understand why men acted so violently.” Along with several other images from the series, Power Headache was later translated into tapestry by Chicago’s long-time collaborator, Audrey Cowan.

Gail Levin’s biography of the artist (""Becoming Judy Chicago,"" Harmony Books, 2007) describes the work as “a series of six volumnar trapezoids of different lengths and colors, made from monochrome-painted canvas stretched over plywood frames. The six trapezoids leaned against a wall at forty-five-degree angles in decreasing order of size.” As noted by Levin, the piece was named for 1960s soul singer Wilson Pickett, but the reference has frequently been lost through misspellings of its name. The original Rainbow Pickett was shown in New York in 1966 as part of the foundational Minimalist exhibition, “Primary Structures,” at the Jewish Museum; the influential critic Clement Greenberg described it then as one of the best works in the exhibition. It was later destroyed by the artist along with other large sculptures because of its storage costs. It was reconstructed in 2004 for LAMOCA’s retrospective exhibition, “A Minimal Future?

The Seasons were began in New York in 1974, but completed in Houston, Texas, in the summer of 1975. Harris Rosenstein, director of the Institute for the Arts at Rice University in Houston at that time, asked Brice Marden and David Novros to create paintings to be installed with four paintings that Rothko did not include in the final Rothko Chapel installation. In response, Marden decided to base his work on the theme of the seasons, as ""I had these paintings in mind for a long time. I was interested in enlivening the space in my paintings. Up to that point they were (independent) monochromatic panel paintings."" His first step was to determine the size and the proportion of the four panels in a series of drawings made with consecutive layers of graphite and wax. ""If I don't use the wax, I can't get this smooth graphite surface. You'd have a furry surface without the wax. So, this gives me a surface that I want. And in effect, it makes these paintings on paper because the wax acts as a binder and the graphite becomes a pigment."" The finished, big-scale version of The Seasons consists of four vertical panels, each eight feet by five, installed with an interval of three inches between them. ""The interval had to do with the overall size of the piece"", explained Marden. The panels were separated as ""in terms of subject matter, they're each unto themselves. Yet they had to be together. I really wanted The Seasons to be able to stand alone."" A small version of The Seasons was created in the same time, as Marden made changes and corrections on it to act as a reference to the color adjustments in the larger panels. The Seasons, Marden's largest work until then, was exhibited, along with the small version, in the spring of 1975 at Rice's Institute for the Arts. But the artist did not consider it finished, so, after the exhibition, he reworked the series and added more layers of paint while changing the hue. ""Color is really something trying to summarize a feeling about each season. If you took them out of context, you'd not get it... it's a thematic thing. (...) Color is a way of arriving at light.""
